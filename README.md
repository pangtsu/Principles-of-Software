# Principles-of-Software

Studied important concepts in software design, implementation, and testing. Topics include specification, abstraction with classes, design principles and patterns, testing, refactoring, the software development process, GUI and event-driven programming, and cloud-based programming. The course also introduces implementation and testing tools, including IDEs, revision control systems, and other frameworks.
- Some of the projects I've done include Implementation of Graph ADT, Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, and the RPI Campus Path Finder using Mode-View-Controller design pattern.
- All programming projects are written in Java.
- Performed unit testing with JUnit.
